Snake game can be built in many different ways

Examples:

1. My repository where I built using REACTJS - CREATE_REACT_APP
2. Simply clone the repo, study and build your own (make changes and try to refactor it): https://github.com/kalwar/SnakeGame
3. Don't just copy-paste but try to understand how it works and replicate based on above example
